The process of slogan creation by humans involves finding key concepts of the company and its products, and developing a memorable short phrase to describe the key concept. We attempt to follow the same sequence, but with an evolutionary algorithm. A user inputs a paragraph describing describing the company or product to be promoted. The system randomly samples initial slogans from a corpus of existing slogans. The initial slogans are then iteratively mutated and improved using an evolutionary algorithm. Mutation randomly replaces words in an individual with words from the input paragraphs. Internal evaluation measures a combination of grammatical correctness, and semantic similarity to the input paragraphs. Subjective analysis of output slogans leads to the conclusion that the algorithm certainly outputs valuable slogans. External evaluation found that the slogans were somewhat successful in conveying a message, because humans were generally able to select the correct promoted item given a slogan.",

		desc: "Current computer vision algorithms using Neural Nets with softmax function can only classify objects in between the labels used for training. If we provide the algorithm with the entirely different image still it will try to classify the image for the labels it knows. It would be amazing if these algorithms could distinguish between the images which are similar to what it has seen before and which are completely different. This problem is known as Open Set recognition problem. Addressing this problem would be tremendous benefits for computer vision as machines will be able to classify the objects more accurately and more robust to fooling images as well as adversarial images. We implement OSDN algorithm using Weibull fitting in the penultimate layers of Neural Nets to address the issue with Open Set recognition problem.",
